I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Bologna. My research focuses on labor economics, gender economics, and social-science genetics.

I study how individual traits and social norms jointly shape human capital formation and labor market outcomes, with particular attention to gender disparities. I am especially interested in the role of genetic data in understanding inequality and the persistence of social gaps.
